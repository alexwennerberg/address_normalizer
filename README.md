# address_normalizer

This is a group project I did at Truman State University for my software engineering course. I worked on a team of six people. I contributed heavily to the architecture and design of the system, as well as the implementation of several user stories, specifically the part of the code that fixes suffixes and secondary unit designators, as well as some other smaller methods.
